## Greetings

1. مرحباً
2. أهلاً
3. هلا

Last one is informal.

4. سلام: peace

## Prepositions

Prepositions never have Tanween nor are affected by any grammatical case.

1. عَنْ: about
2. مِنْ: from
3. إلَى: to
4. عَلَى: on, upon, on top of

## Possessive prepositions

Recall the possessive pronouns from the previous lesson.

To say "a pen to you" to a male:

1. a pen --> قَلَمٌ
2. to you --> إلى+ك

Since Alif Maqsura (ى) cannot come in the middle of a word (review [lesson3](https://al-mubeen.com/3-diacritics/)), it must be transformed to Yaa (ي), so:

3. to you --> إليك

The same rule applies for preposition "على":

Example: السلام عليكم

1. السلام: is ال+سلام, meaning "the peace" or just "peace"
2. عليكم: is على+كم, which is transformed to "عليكم" according to the previous rule.
