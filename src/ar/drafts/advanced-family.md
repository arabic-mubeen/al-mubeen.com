An alternative word is used to emphasize biological relatedness:

<div style="text-align:center; font-size: 150%;">
    وَالِدٌ
</div>

Literally means "male begetter" or just father. "The simplifying assumption" from [lesson5](http://al-mubeen.com/5-pronouns) works here. So to address it to a mother:

<div style="text-align:center; font-size: 150%;">
    وَالِدَةٌ
</div>
