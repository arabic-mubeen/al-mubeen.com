Arabic diacritics, often called Tashkeel (تشكيل), are used to give a word its exact pronunciation.

Arabic has 3 vowels: Alif (ا), Waw (و), and Yaa (ي), which are referred to as long vowels. Arabic is written similar to how [disemvowelled English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disemvoweling) sentences are written. For example, this sentence: "Yu lrn Arbc" is the disemvoweled sentence of "You learn Arabic".

Arabic diacritics consist of:

1. Harakat (حركات): to indicate short vowels.
2. Tanween (تنوين): to indicate adding a nun (ن) to the end of the word.
3. Sukoon (سكون): to indicate absence of vowel.
4. Shadda (شدّة): to indicate a stress in a vowel.

## Tanween

1. **<u>Rule of Tanween</u>**: Tanween indicates indefinite article.

From this rule we can conclude:

1. Tanween is **always** at the end of the word.
2. Tanween cannot be applied to verbs or prepositions.
3. When there is Tanween on a word, it must be a noun.
4. And this noun, cannot be preceded by the Arabic "the" (ال) because it is indefinite.

### Tanween FatH (ـً)

The special thing about Tanween FatH (ـً) is that it is often accompanied by a silent Alif (ا)

Example: شُكراً (Shukran - Thanks)

Notice that Tanween is fully pronounced despite stopping.

## Rule of Stopping

It is more natural in speech to dismiss the last diacritics when stopping at a word (e.g: taking a breath, full stop, etc.).

Throughout the lessons, we may disregard this rule to clarify correct diacritics. The rule of stopping does not apply to long vowels; they will still be pronounced.

Example1: مُحمّدٌ جيّدٌ (Muhammed is good)

Written as: "Muhammadun Jayyedun", but pronounced as "Muhammadun Jayyed", since we stopped at "جيّدٌ" but continued on "مُحمّدٌ".

Rule of stopping is often disregarded for Tanween FatH

Example2: شُكراً جزيلاً (Thank you very much)

Pronounced: "Shukran Jazeelan" with a nun pronounced on both words.

### Taa Marbuta (ـة)

Taa Marbuta is just Taa (ت) and Haa (ـه) joined together.

![Taa Marbuta is Taa and Haa](/taa-marbuta.png) 

Taa Marbuta is pronounced Taa (ت) when its diacritic is pronounced, and as a Haa (ه) when dismissing diacritics. To remember this rule here is a mnemonic:

1. [H]alt: Haa ه
2. [T]anween or con[T]inue: Taa ت

Taa Marbuta (ـة) <u>**always**</u> comes at the end of *nouns*, and as a rule of thumb, most of these nouns are feminine. In the next lesson we will cover more about gender in Arabic.
