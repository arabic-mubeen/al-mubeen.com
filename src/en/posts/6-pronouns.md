## The Basic Gender Recipe

As a beginner, you can make the following simplifying assumptions on gender, which we will refer to as the basic recipe:

* If a noun ends with Taa Marbuta (ـة), then it is most likely feminine, otherwise it is most likely masculine.

The opposite is roughly a correct rule too:

* If an adjective is masculine, then adding (ـة) will make it feminine.

## This

1. هَذَا: haaTha

Means "this" for a masculine noun. We will denote it by "this [m]" for short.

2. هَذِهِ: haaThehe

Means "this" for a feminine noun. We will denote it by "this [f]" for short.

Common mistake: هَذِهِ ends with a regular Haa (ه) not Taa Marbuta (ة)

Notice that in both Arabic "this" words, there is no Alif like: (هاذا), (هاذه) despite pronouncing it. Why is that? because "this" is so common that it became typical to drop its Alif.

## Subject pronouns

1. أنا: I/I am
2. أَنْتَ: You [m]
3. أَنْتِ: You [f]
4. هُوَ: he
5. هِيَ: she

## What about Am, Is, Are?

Arabic grammar is concise. Want to say "Sky is blue"? just put "blue" after "sky" in a sentence: "sky blue". Applying this concept, to say:

1. I am good --> أنا جيد
2. He is good --> هو جيد
3. She is good --> هي جيدة

Notice in the last example, since "She" is feminine, we had to transform masculine adjective to feminine by adding (ة).
