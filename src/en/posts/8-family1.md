This lesson is a review for the [possessive case](/possessive). It's recommended to review the "rule of stopping" in [lesson3](/diacritics/), and "the basic recipe" in [lesson5](/pronouns/).

There is a kind of symmetry in Arabic family names.

## Parents

| أَبٌ   | Father | Ab[un]  |
| ---- | ------ | ------- |
| أّمٌّ   | Mother | Umm[un] |

Notice the stress (Shadda) on the meem of أُمٌّ.

Simple mnemonic: [Ab] and [Um] are the reverse of the first letters of [ba]ba, and [ma]ma.

## Siblings

This is where "the simple recipe" alters a bit. Instead of using Taa Marbuta (ـة) we use regular Taa (ت) to transform (أخ) brother to (أخت) sister.

| أخٌ   | Brother | Akh[un]  |
| ---- | ------- | -------- |
| أُختٌ  | Sister  | Ukht[un] |

## Back to possessive

The words for father and brother have a special case when in possessive. It's simply an additional Waw (و) added to the end when they belong to a possessor.

Example: أبو مُحَمّدٍ (Abu Mohammad[en]: Mohammad's father)

Since "أب" belongs to "مُحمّد", a Waw is added to the end.

Example2: أخو زيدٍ
