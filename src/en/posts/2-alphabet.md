Arabic is one of the few languages that it is written from right to left. The alphabet consists of 28 letters but many of them share the same base glyph. Arabic is cursive by nature, meaning that wbords generally consist of letters connected together, and so they change form depending on their position in the word. However they do not different much from their base glyphs. All letters connect to the letter forward, except for 6 letters.
