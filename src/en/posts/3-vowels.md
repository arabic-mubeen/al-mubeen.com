Arabic diacritics, often called Tashkeel (تشكيل), are used to give a word its exact pronunciation.

Arabic has 3 vowel letters (aka long vowels): Alif (ا), Waw (و), and Yaa (ي), and equivalent three short vowels. Arabic is written similar to how [disemvowelled English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disemvoweling) sentences are written. For example, this sentence: "Yu lrn Arbc" is the disemvoweled sentence of "You learn Arabic".

Arabic diacritics consist of:

1. Harakat (حركات): to indicate short vowels.
2. Tanween (تنوين): to indicate adding a nun (ن) to the end of the word.
3. Sukoon (سكون): to indicate absence of vowel.
4. Shadda (شدّة): to indicate a stress in a vowel.

## Tanween

* **Rule of Tanween**: Tanween indicates indefinite article.

From this rule we can conclude:

1. Tanween is always at the end of the word.
2. Tanween cannot be applied to verbs or prepositions.
3. When there is Tanween on a word, it must be a noun.

### Tanween FatH (ـً)

The special thing about Tanween FatH (ـً) is that it is often accompanied by a silent Alif (ا)

Example: شُكراً (Shukran - Thanks)
