## The Basic Gender Recipe

As a beginner, you can make the following simplifying assumptions on gender, which we will refer to as the basic gender recipe:

* If a noun ends with Taa Marbuta (ـة), then it is most likely feminine, otherwise it is most likely masculine.

Examples: try to guess the gender of these random words

1. مُدَرِّس
2. مَدرسَةٌ
3. قاعٌ
4. قاعةٌ
5. دولة
6. جيِّدٌ
7. جَيّدةٌ

Solution: [♂️, ♀️, ♂️, ♀️, ♀️, ♂️, ♀️]

You may have noticed from these examples some pattern. The opposite is roughly a correct rule too but on adjectives:

* If an adjective is masculine, then adding Taa Marbuta (ة) will make it feminine.

### Reversed adjectives

Finally, an important note is that noun/adjectives order is reversed: so to say "Good pen" in Arabic, first you say the noun then the adjectives.

Exercises: We learned basic words from previous lessons, let's review some and make sentences:

| Adjective [m] | Pronunciation | Translation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| جَيِّدٌ           | jayyed[un]    | good        |
| سَيِّئٌ           | sayye'[un]    | bad         |
| جَمِيلٌ          | jameel[un]    | beautiful   |

Exercises:

* Beautiful sea

From the basic recipe we guess that بحر is masculine, and it should come before what describes it: جميل. So the translation is: بَحْرٌ جَميلٌ.

*  Beautiful girl

Girl in Arabic is "بنتٌ" which is feminine, so "جميل" is converted to feminine by adding (ة): بِنتٌ جَميلَةٌ

## This

1. هَذَا: haaḏa

Means "this" for a masculine noun. We will denote it by "this [m]" for short.

2. هَذِهِ: haaḏehe

Means "this" for a feminine noun. We will denote it by "this [f]" for short.

Common mistake: هَذِهِ ends with a regular Haa (ه) not Taa Marbuta (ة)

Notice that in both Arabic "this" words, there is no Alif like: (هاذا), (هاذه) despite pronouncing it. Why is that? because "this" is so common that it became typical to drop its Alif.

Examples:

* This is a good boy

Good boy --> boy good -->  وَلَدٌ جيِّدٌ

This is a good boy --> هذا وَلَدٌ جيِّدٌ

* This is a big sea

Big sea --> sea big --> بَحرٌ كَبيرٌ

This is a big sea --> هذا بَحْرٌ كَبيرٌ

To say this is a big sea, just add "this [m]".

## Pronouns

### 1) Ana (I am)

* أنا: I

Example1:

* I am good

If you are a woman you choose the feminine version of "good":

1. ♂️: أنا جَيّدٌ
2. ♀️: أنا جَيّدةٌ

Exercises: translate this in the comments.

*  I am beautiful.

### 2) Anta (You [m])

* أَنْتَ: You [m]

### 3) Ante (You [f])

* أَنْتِ: You [f]

### 4) Huwa (he)

* هُوَ: he

### 5 Heya (she)

* هِيَ: she

## What about Am, Is, Are?

Arabic grammar is concise. Want to say "Sky is blue"? just put "blue" after "sky" in a sentence: "sky blue". Applying this concept, to say:

1. I am good --> أنا جيد
2. He is good --> هو جيد
3. She is good --> هي جيدة

Notice in the last example, since "She" is feminine, we had to transform masculine adjective to feminine by adding (ة).
